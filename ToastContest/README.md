Core Tech’s coding challenge initiative encourages you to freshen up on your technical skills. This is a fantastic way to practice with new frameworks, prepare for interview questions, and engage with the SWE community!

Directions: 
1.	Carefully look at the Toast Popup example. 
2.	Using the tech stack/framework of your choice (React, Angular, Material UI, Bootstrap, etc.) , replicate the Toast Popup functionality.
3.	Once completed, send to @Greta Schock either format:

Note that there’s bonus points for stylization creativity!
